### 𝐇&𝐌 - 𝐇𝐞𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐬 & 𝐌𝐚𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐳
When the terms "fast fashion" and "affordability" are used in relation to today's apparel industry. H&M, a company that is related to other companies like ZARA, UNIQLO, GAP, Forever 21, and many more, plays a significant role in this. 

Erling Persson had the idea to launch this well-known business in 1947 because he wanted to make beautiful clothes accessible and inexpensive to everyone. He did this the proper way by starting a single store back then called H&M, or Hennes & Mauritz, but who knew that this idea of his would become fantastic and the go-to store today, providing people from all over the world with fashion and design?

The Swedish entrepreneur Persson's visit to New York City served as inspiration for H&M, according to its history. In Sweden's Väster's, he inaugurated a new womenswear shop. In Swedish, "Hers" is called "Hennes," so he names it that. Soon after purchasing Mauritz Widforss, a supplier of fishing gear, the business began carrying men's and kids' apparel, serving the demands of the complete family in terms of fashion. Hennes & Mauritz, the company's current name, was quickly followed by H&M, the abbreviation for Hennes & Mauritz.  This wise decision resulted in global expansion, which first started to emerge in Norway, and then moved on to Denmark, the UK, and Switzerland. With the introduction of five or six additional stores each year, the growth pace quickens even further. 

While H&M's physical locations are expanding over the world, it is their daily, monthly, and annual sales that truly distinguish them as a top competitor. We will be able to evaluate and examine how this fast fashion company functions and maintains its engine to continue operating from its nine decades of production with the aid of the data that is now available from Kaggle, catering to the dominance of this brand in the United States of America. 

The historical data contains tons of records for the H&M products sale. H&M – Hennes & Mauritz AB is a Swedish multinational clothing-retail company known for its fast-fashion clothing for men, women, teenagers, and children.
